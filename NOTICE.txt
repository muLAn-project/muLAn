General information about muLAn
===============================

Authership and copyrights
-------------------------

muLAn is a MicroLensing Analysis software. Its general purpose is to
provide a tool to analysis and model microlensing events. The original
version was developped at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris
(France) and at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (USA).

    The project muLAn has become open-source in 2017. This means that
all muLAn contributors are the copyright holders, with important
exceptions: all muLAn external routines are distributed with their own
copyrights (see section ??). The other files (called hereafter
internal routines) are distributed under the MIT License (please see
section `License`).

    Since 2017, the version control system `git` is used to develop
muLAn. This provides a tool to collaborate and to keep better records
for attribution purposes.
